## Summary
Tested multiuser capabilities; debugged (a lot); attended meetings.

## Details
With the demo out of the way, we discussed our framework's multiuser
capabilities (currently out of commission) and began working on that
(in order to deploy it on the Web for future data collection, etc.).
This mostly involved a ton of annoying compilation/runtime setbacks and such.
