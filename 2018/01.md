## Summary
Set up work environment; read papers; parsed log files.

## Details
After ArticuLab onboarding, I started out by setting up my new work laptop,
officially named the Cookiegorgon. This included downloading things like
Gradle and Sublime Text, setting up command line shortcuts, etc.

This week turned out to be good timing for the menial and manual labor of
setup, as the team was away for a couple days demo-ing their work in
Silicon Valley. To pass the time, I also read some papers on rapport and put
together a literature review.

Finally, I wrote up a quick Java program to parse our system's log files, which
record user/agent utterances, and turn the data into a nice .csv transcript.
