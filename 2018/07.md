## Summary
Debugged and tested; trained NLU; gave small demo.

## Details
More debugging and testing (and consequent fixing) for the demo; we also worked
to run the full system with all of its improved components.

And I retrained the NLU based on new data, which involved a side trail of
inexplicable compilation errors but was fun once I was able to feed sentences
in (and test out the new model).

Finally, our team gave a small demo (I spoke with Sara!) for a couple of
inpromptu (but important) visitors, which was a good practice run for next
week's big demo. Afterwards, we all exchanged feedback/suggestions on our
respective parts as well as on our question-answering.
