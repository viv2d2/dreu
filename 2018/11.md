## Summary
Began constructing new NLG.

## Details
This week, I finally got to constructing the new (and hopefully improved) NLG,
designed by me and based on Shruti's new computational model re: giving movie
recommendation information. It's of course nowhere near where I'd like it to
be, but testing what I currently have has helped me uncover some "loopholes"
and determine new rules to be put in place; and going over the system with
Shruti has helped me better understand how to generate accurate and effective
responses.
