## Summary
Ran a computer-computer interaction; attended/presented at the demo!

## Details
With the demo on Thursday, we spent the preceding days fixing a ton of
last-minute things (including patching up last-minute loopholes, in the lack
of time to come up with elegant solutions) (also, recording a test run of
Sara and me chatting to show Justine, who gave feedback on both the scenario
and nonverbal behaviors).

Alankar and I also came up with a last-minute (but brilliant) thing to add to
our demo presentation—since he's been working on a user simulator and I've been
working on Sara's architecture, we hooked our systems up for some
computer-computer interaction. Yoichi added TTS, so we could hear our systems
speak to one another (we also had to significantly slow our systems down–their
exchanges were so quick we couldn't even read the screen as it scrolled), and
the final product was so, so cool (also funny, because the user simulator's
rather serious and Sara's currently quite sassy).

After a string of long nights (spent on everything I previously mentioned,
plus presentation prep), we arrived at 7:45am on Demo Day to put the finishing
(formatting) touches on our slides; move our lab's resident Microsoft Surface
up to the demo room; and grab continental breakfast. The event took all day
(as there were several demos, all extremely interesting)–we had the slot after
a second coffee break and before lunch, which turned out to be ideal, and
everything was practically perfect.
