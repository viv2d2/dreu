## Summary
Researched NLG; constructed a new DM.

## Details
This week, I read up on existing NLG systems, particularly regarding content
planning (which is what I'm focusing on at the moment). Note: NLG consists of
first content planning (deciding *what* to say) and then sentence planning
(deciding *how* to say it).

I also constructed a new (very simpleâ€”hoping to revamp this soon) DM that works
better with the multiuser aspect of the framework.
