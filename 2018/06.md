## Summary
Tested/fixed system; updated DM and NLG.

## Details
I spent the week working on a temporary NLG module for the demo (better than
the current one, but not as flexible/organic as what I hope to do after the
demo), as well as revamping the DM (to accommodate our new scenario ideas as
well as to work with the new NLG).

Since the PI was away at a conference, I also got to run our weekly team
meeting!
