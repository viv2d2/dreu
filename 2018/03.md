## Summary
Read/debugged code; upgraded log analysis tool; fixed modules.

## Details
I continued extended-movie-functionality work by diving into the project's
current code (which I thought had a serious issue until I looked into past Git
commits and realized a boolean had been discretely switched from true to
false).

Also, remember the log-to-transcript parsing thing? I extended that little
package of code to a tool that analyzes time delays throughout the entire
system (based on log messages, which have timestamps) (note: I did this last
year, too, but I had to kind of start over/revamp last year's structure because
the project has changed so much). Anyway, I used the results of said tool to
target certain (slow) parts of the architecture and make interactions speedy
once again.
