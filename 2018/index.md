## Hello
I'm Viv, and this website is for my Summer 2018 adventures at the ArticuLab,
where I'm conducting research through the DREU program.

## Project
I'm working on natural language generation, specifically content planning,
for a socially-aware virtual agent who recommends movies. (I'm also working to
improve general functionality of and the architectural stucture behind said
agent.)

## About
And last but not least, some quick info:

- **The ArticuLab:** where I'm interning!
- **My mentor:** Justine Cassell is a human-computer interaction researcher under the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (though right now, she's on sabbatical doing exciting work in France)
- **Me:** I'm Vivian Tsai, and I just finished my third year at Johns Hopkins University, where I study computer science and applied math in the Whiting School of Engineering
