## Summary
Added OMDb functionality; attended meetings; did rapport annotations.

## Details
I started off the week by first deciphering the current Dialog Manager
(created using DialogOS), then extending it to query OMDb for additional movie
info. Along the way, I wrote up documentation and dealt with some strange blips
re: running the framework (i.e., JitPack).

We also had a lot of meetings this week: one re: potential improvements to the
NLG; another re: a coding manual for the ArticuLab; and a third re: the
scenario for our movie agent. (Also, our weekly interns' meeting, during which
we read research papers for the projects we're not on.)

Finally, I spent all of Friday with my fellow intern-teammates, doing rapport
annotations for transcripts and trying to reach IRR.
