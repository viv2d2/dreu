## Summary
Planned demo functionality; reviewed team literature; called in sick.

## Details
Since our team has a huge demo coming up mid-July, we held quite a few meetings
this week to start ironing out kinks and figuring out what (realistic)
improvements to make to the system in time. I worked some more on the OMDb
incorporation to make sure it'd run smoothly for the demo.

All of us interns also met to discuss the rapport literature that we all read.

Sadly, I wasn't feeling well mid-week, so I missed out on a couple ArticuLab
workdays.

Finally, our team discussed my post-demo plans for designing a new NLG module
(which I'm super excited about!).
