## Summary
Last week!

## Details
Final days at the ArticuLab! I continued working on my new NLG module; wrote up
documentation; and fixed up some functional/architectural things with the DM.
I also helped other lab members set up their laptop environments so they'd be
able to run my code on their own.

What else? I gave a last-minute demo for a visiting researcher; cleaned up my
code; and, on Friday, gave my exit interview (aka, sat down for an hour and
talked about what went well, what could've gone better, and what I got out of
the summer).
