Things I did before arriving at the ArticuLab.

## Training
I completed CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) training
for responsible conduct of social/behavioral research.

## Meeting with DREU mentor
Shortly after receiving my DREU match, I talked with Justine via phone about
my interests in general, the ArticuLab's current projects, and which of those
projects I might be interested in (which meant a terribly incoherent mess from
me, a lot of exciting facts from Justine, and some more (enthusiastic)
incoherence from me, respectively).

## Choosing projects
I had two video-chat meetings with the leads of the RAPT and SARA projects
to learn more about each project and decide which one to join over the summer.
Both meetings were super informative, and everyone was super friendly.
(I ended up choosing the SARA project.)

## Miscellaneous
Lauren, the ArticuLab lab manager, gave me lots of helpful information and
hints re: house hunting in Pittsburgh. She also introduced me to the
ArticuLab's three other DREU interns via email.
