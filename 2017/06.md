title: Week 6

This Friday, I gave a presentation on my work so far and what I plan to do for
the rest of my internship (and as a result of said presentation, most of the
week was spent panicking slash killing my voice slash not sleeping).

The fact that I'm writing this now means that a) I survived, and
b) I am just about halfway done with my internship!
(Sure enough, my DREU midterm report, is due this week.)
I'm still trying to decide what's harder to believe: that I've been here for
half a summer already, or that I only have half a summer left.
