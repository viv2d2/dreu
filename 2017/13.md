title: Week 13
---

Penultimate week at the ArticuLab: I did user study things, glared at a lot of
statistical terms, and tried to pull my internship work (i.e., analysis tool
and dataset in progress) together and start tying loose ends.

If I had to break down my week into three tasks, I'd say 1) continued running
my user study, 2) learned about different statistical tests and decided
which one would fit my dataset best (more on all that below), and 3)
adjusted my analysis tool so it would process my data properly.

Part 2 in a nutshell: basically, I spent a whole lot of time puzzling over
statistical tests and wishing I could better understand them. I'm embarrassed
to say that the only thing I remember from high school stats is that time I
stayed up all night using technology (to analyze data on people staying up all
night to use technology) and ate an entire bowl of pudding.

I also realized that I haven't touched my graphing calculator since high school
stats, during which the most significant thing I used said calculator for was
entering in the measurements for one hundred different blades of grass
(that's right, not even actual graphing).

Anyway, this is (kind of?) terrible, but I ultimately gave up on the stats
proofs (sorry, eigenvalues) and decided to be content with knowing which test
to use when and what the outcome of each test means. I do eventually want to
fully understand how smart people came up with all these means of analysis, but
for now, I suppose doing the actual analysis is more important.
