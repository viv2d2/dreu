title: Week 10

This week, I got the phone code to work (!) and continued working on my user
study.

More specifically, I set up middleware code on my laptop and am currently
trying to identify the time delay in said code. This is rather time-consuming
because the phone code takes 38942048119031 minutes to build each time I alter
something.
