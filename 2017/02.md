title: Week 2

This week, Justine brought cake to the ArticuLab.
I typed up the data structure (planned at the end of Week 1),
learned some cool Java tricks,
and spent over an hour debugging to find that I'd accidentally written a
1 instead of an i.

After I constructed the (previously discussed) data structure (using Vim),
Timo advocated for IDEs and Gradle for a bit (and helped me set that up).
He also shuffled around my code to improve functionality, which was quite
interesting (and informative) to watch—I later finished the shuffling, then
adapted the whole thing to work for multiple phone conversations at the same
time. And after getting all that in shape, I moved more stuff around so my
code could spit out nice(r) looking statistics instead of a mess of numbers
(yay for organization).

Something that's come up over the past week is my tendency to
"reinvent the wheel" (also inundate my code with Javadoc comments;
Checkstyle has scarred me for life.) I tend to do it because it's what we tend
to do in school—our assignments aren't to use HashMaps and priority heaps
and skip lists, they're to *write* them.
For this internship, I've thus done a lot of implementing things that have
already been implemented, which is not a great use of time. But hopefully I am
getting better about this!
