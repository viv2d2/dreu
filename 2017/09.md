This week, I applied for an IRB for my user study,
which took a lot longer than I thought it would.

I also met with various people to discuss:

- Restructuring the phone code
- Planning for user studies
- Applying for an IRB (Lauren very generously reviewed my application and fixed all my messy phrasing)
