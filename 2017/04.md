title: Week 4

This week, I fixed up my GUI code (as in, added more functionality, altered
some strange logical decisions, and cleaned up as best I could). There were
also a lot of little things I sort-of-but-didn't-really cover earlier (like
that awkward time difference between Android phones and the multiuser
frameworkâ€”important because I'm comparing timestamps) that I straightened out
this week.
