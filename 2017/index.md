## Project
Carnegie Mellon's InMind team is working on an intelligent, socially aware
movie agent who, through a mobile application, gives users personalized
movie recommendations.

Because the movie agent is so intelligent and socially aware, she sometimes
takes a while to respond to users (due to processing delays). This summer,
I fixed this by:

- Analyzing the time delays that occurred during the movie agent's interactions
- Establishing a plan to apply incremental processing to the agent's architecture (in order to reduce said delays)
- Executing said plan
- Conducting a user study to evaluate the impact of my faster (incremental) system on user's interactions with the movie agent

## Goals
- Work with a complex software architecture (and the people behind it)
- Use rigorous testing to estimate performance (regarding time) of a system
- Learn about incremental processing and how it can improve responsiveness
- Incorporate incremental processing into a currently non-incremental system
- Engage in scientific writing, proposals to/discussions with relevant stakeholders, and documentation/analysis of architectural decisions in a system
