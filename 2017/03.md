title: Week 3
---

This week, it rained on Monday. I fretted over and shuffled around my code
a bit and added some functionality, most notably the ability to convert
statistics into graphics.

At the beginning of the week, we had some technical
(is that the technical term?) difficulties. Since Plan A (collecting logs)
and Plan B (writing integration tests) didn't work out, Timo came up with a
Plan C: learn how to play with graphical user interfaces. I haven't done
anything GUI-related before, so it was pretty interesting (if not quick,
because I am slow) to finally figure that out.

I also went through a mid-week crisis where I decided I could come up with a
better options than my currently strangely-schema-ed data structure, tried to
rewrite said data structure twice, and eventually reverted to the original.
I did, however, switch some things so that it'll run for either simultaneous
phone conversations or not-simultaneous phone conversations (in a "comment out
either Line A or Line B" sort of way).

Finally, I collected some data (via letting the other interns chat with Sara)
and analyzed it (which involved altering/adding to my current code so I could
make better conclusions).
