This week, I collected data, which sounds boring but was actually kind of
super exciting (read: I have been waiting for a while to collect data).

In terms of data, I recorded (as in, collected both audio and log files for)
conversations that other interns had with Sara. In terms of fixing up my
analysis tool (which I am constantly doing), I altered some more functionality
and, more excitingly, figured out a nice timeline visual with click options
(click options are the best!). Since I'm presenting my results next week,
I also started brainstorming for/struggling with that.
