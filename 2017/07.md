title: Week 7
---

I spent a good chunk of the week getting up to speed on code
(both Java and Python) from various parts of the architectureâ€”prep work,
if you will. I've broken my overall goal into three tasks: change some Java
code, change some Python code, and change the code that connects the Java
code to the Python code. By Friday, I was able to check the first off and
start on the second.

Timo also helped me set up a test client for the Python code
(which was particularly excellent because I spent 284390 hours attempting the
same thing and miserably failing).
